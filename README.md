# VueFullStackDemo
My demo project for vue to show my full stack capabilities

I decided to implement a Pokemart, with pokemart.html being the landing page for the demo, I used vue.js as the frontend framkework as well as Node.js (express) for the backend, and Oracle mysql for the database
There is the main brach with the demo feautures, as well a WIP branch as a personal project to further expand my vu and node skills. If you have any questions, please email me at aalramahi5585@gmail.com
